# EVcouplings-EVfold

Draws extendable regions from existing EVcouplings-EVfold alignment data and directly executes commands for extending those regions.
Extends regions by
1) joining consecutive regions that satisfy the rule and
2) stretching 50 amino acids both to the left and to the right if an isolated region satisfies the rule.
